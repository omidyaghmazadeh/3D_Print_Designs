This is an open-source versatile animal conditioning set-up for MRI (an other imaging) experiments on mice and rats. 
The design is made in a collaborative effort between the Buzsaki Lab (Neuroscience Institute), the Alon Lab (Radiology Dep.), and the Preclinical Imaging Lab (Radiology Dep.) at the NYU Langone Medical Center.

Parts with finer dimensions are optimized for Form 2 printer from Formlab. Adjustments might be needed for other printers.
The stand.stl and walls.stl might be printed by most printers without issue.

The complete and easy-to-modify design (developed using Autodesk Fusion 360) is available at: https://a360.co/3u0Dsnh.
