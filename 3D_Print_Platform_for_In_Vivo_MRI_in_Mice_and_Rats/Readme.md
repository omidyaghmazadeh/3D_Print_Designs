Parts with finer dimensions are optimized for Form 2 printer from Formlab. Adjustment might be needed for other printers.
The stand.stl and walls.stl might be printed by most printers without issue.

The complete and easy-to-modify design (developed using Autodesk Fusion 360) is available at: https://a360.co/3u0Dsnh.
