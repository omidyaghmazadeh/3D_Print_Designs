This is a headfixation set-up for neuroscience experiments on mice. 
The head-cap is designed to provide a large surface on the skull for implanting probes, fibers, etc.

Parts with finer dimensions are optimized for Form 2 printer from Formlab. Adjustment might be needed for other printers.
The stand.stl and walls.stl might be printed by most printers without issue.

The headfixation mechanism was modified based on Mihaly Voroslakos' design available at:
